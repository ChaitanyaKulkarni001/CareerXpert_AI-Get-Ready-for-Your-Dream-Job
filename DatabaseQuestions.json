        "question": "Worker X completes a task in 8 days, and Worker Y completes it in 10 days. How many days will they take together?",
        "options": {
          "A": "4 days",
          "B": "5 days",
          "C": "6 days",
          "D": "7 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Worker X’s one-day work = 1/8, Worker Y’s one-day work = 1/10. Together, they complete (1/8 + 1/10) = 1/4.44, so they finish the task in approximately 5 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "John and Sam working together can complete a project in 6 days. If John alone takes 10 days to finish the work, how many days will Sam take alone to complete it?",
        "options": {
          "A": "13 days",
          "B": "14 days",
          "C": "15 days",
          "D": "16 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "John and Sam together complete 1/6 of the work in a day. John alone does 1/10 per day. Sam's one day work = (1/6 - 1/10) = 1/15. So, Sam will take 15 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "A can do a task in 10 days, and B can do the same task in 15 days. If they work together but stop after four days, what fraction of the task remains unfinished?",
        "options": {
          "A": "3/10",
          "B": "4/10",
          "C": "5/10",
          "D": "6/10"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "A's one day work = 1/10, B's one day work = 1/15. Together, they complete 1/10 + 1/15 = 1/6 of the work in a day. In 4 days, they finish 4/6 = 2/3 of the work. Remaining work = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3."
      },
      {
        "question": "Adam is twice as efficient as Ryan. When they work together, they finish a task in 16 days. How many days will Ryan take alone?",
        "options": {
          "A": "46 days",
          "B": "48 days",
          "C": "50 days",
          "D": "52 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adam and Ryan together complete 1/16 of the work in a day. Since Adam is twice as efficient as Ryan, he does 2/3 of the work while Ryan does 1/3. Ryan's one day work = 1/48, so he takes 48 days alone."
      },
      {
        "question": "Paul can complete a task in 12 days, and Rob can complete it in 10 days. With the help of Sam, they complete the work in 4 days. How many days will Sam alone take to complete the job?",
        "options": {
          "A": "15 days",
          "B": "14 days",
          "C": "13 days",
          "D": "12 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "A",
        "explanation": "Paul's one day work = 1/12, Rob's one day work = 1/10. Together with Sam, their work per day is 1/4. Sam’s one day work = (1/4 - 1/12 - 1/10) = 1/15, so he completes the task in 15 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "Eli, Jake, and Oscar can complete a task in 10, 20, and 40 days respectively. If Eli is assisted by Jake and Oscar every third day, in how many days will the task be completed?",
        "options": {
          "A": "6 days",
          "B": "7 days",
          "C": "8 days",
          "D": "9 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "Eli’s one day work = 1/10, Jake’s = 1/20, Oscar’s = 1/40. Every 3 days, Eli works alone for 2 days and with others on the third. Work done in 3 days = 2/10 + (1/10 + 1/20 + 1/40) = 3/8. So, the task is completed in 8 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "If 5 workers can paint a 50-meter-long wall in 5 days, in how many days can 4 workers paint a 40-meter-long wall?",

          "A": "3 days",
          "B": "4 days",
          "C": "5 days",
          "D": "6 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "C",
        "explanation": "One worker paints 10 meters in 5 days, so 2 meters per day. Four workers paint 8 meters per day. For 40 meters, time taken = 40/8 = 5 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "If 4 workers can complete 4 times a task in 4 days, in how many days can 6 workers complete 6 times the same task?",
        "options": {
          "A": "3 days",
          "B": "4 days",
          "C": "5 days",
          "D": "6 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "One worker takes 4 days for one task, so 6 workers take 4 days for 6 times the work."
      },
      {
        "question": "Peter can do a job in 10 days, and Adam is 50% more efficient than Peter. In how many days can Adam complete the same job?",
        "options": {
          "A": "6.2 days",
          "B": "6.6 days",
          "C": "7 days",
          "D": "7.2 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "B",
        "explanation": "Adam is 50% more efficient, so the ratio of time taken is 2:3. If Peter takes 10 days, Adam takes (2/3) × 10 = 6.6 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "Charlie can complete a task in 30 days, and Daniel alone can do it in 20 days. If Charlie starts the task and Daniel joins after 10 days, in how many total days will the task be completed?",
        "options": {
          "A": "15 days",
          "B": "16 days",
          "C": "17 days",
          "D": "18 days"
        },
        "correct_answer": "D",
        "explanation": "Charlie’s one-day work = 1/30, in 10 days he completes 1/3 of the task. Remaining work = 2/3. Daniel’s one-day work = 1/20, together they do (1/30 + 1/20) = 1/12 per day. Remaining work = (2/3) × 12 = 8 days. Total = 10 + 8 = 18 days."
